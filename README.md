# VPN Privacy & Secure Communication â€“ Practical

## Task Summary
Tested the use of a VPN to protect privacy and ensure secure communication.

## What I Did
1. Selected **VeePN Chrome extension** as the VPN client.
2. Installed and connected to a **Netherlands server (Haarlem)**.
3. Verified IP change using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
4. Browsed websites to confirm traffic encryption.
5. Disconnected VPN and checked IP reverted to original.
6. Compared browsing speeds with and without VPN.
7. Researched VPN encryption, benefits, and limitations.

## Results
- **Before VPN:** IP showed my real location in Maharashtra, India.
- **After VPN:** IP changed to Netherlands (Haarlem), showing effective masking.
- **After Disconnecting:** IP reverted to my original ISP and location.
- **Observation:** VPN masked IP successfully with slight speed reduction.

## Conclusion
VPNs like VeePN are useful for hiding IP addresses, encrypting traffic, and bypassing geo-blocks. However, free VPNs may log data and slightly reduce browsing speed.
